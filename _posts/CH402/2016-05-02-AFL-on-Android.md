I took one whole holiday to set up this blog system on github pages. It's been near a year since I ungraduated from college and never take a real holiday. 
 
I just work on mobile security research and get intervolution with my fear and anger.
Maybe the difference between they and me is I'm lack of some pure. Abandoning emotion is
too hard for me and they just exceed me with this. 

Can it ferment if I keep immersioning in emotion?
